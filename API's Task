While we often use the terms interchangeably, authorization and authentication are two separate functions. 
Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, and authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to

Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. 
Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.
While authentication and authorization might sound similar, 
they are distinct security processes in the world of identity and access management (IAM).

Define Requirements:

Clearly define the requirements of your application. Understand what types of users you have (e.g., regular users, admins) and what actions they should be able to perform (e.g., access user-specific data, modify application settings).
Select a Technology Stack:

Choose the programming language, framework, and database technology that best suits your project's needs. Popular choices include Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, Express.js, and more.
Design the Database Schema:

Create a database schema to store user information, roles, permissions, and session tokens. Common tables include users, roles, permissions, and user_roles to establish relationships.
Implement User Registration (/register):

Develop an endpoint that allows users to register by providing necessary information (e.g., username, email, password). Ensure password hashing and validation to enhance security.
Implement User Login (/login):

Create an endpoint for user authentication. Validate user credentials, generate an authentication token (e.g., JWT), and return it to the client. Store the token securely on the client-side.
Token-Based Authentication:

Implement middleware to authenticate API requests using the tokens. Decode and verify the token, and grant or deny access accordingly.
Authorization and Permissions:

Define roles and permissions for your application. Roles like "user," "admin," or "moderator" can be assigned specific permissions. Implement logic to check if a user has the required permissions to access specific endpoints or perform certain actions.
User Profile (/profile):

Develop endpoints to retrieve and update user profiles. Ensure that users can only access and modify their own profiles unless they have appropriate permissions to manage other users.
Logout (/logout):

Create an endpoint for users to log out. This can involve invalidating or revoking the authentication token issued during login.
Error Handling and Security:

Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful responses to clients and log any security-related incidents. Consider implementing security features like rate limiting, brute force protection, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers.
Testing:

Thoroughly test your API using different scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, authentication failures, and authorization checks. Use testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Postman for API testing.
Documentation:

Create clear and comprehensive documentation for your API, including how to use each endpoint, expected responses, and examples.
Security Auditing:

Regularly review your API for potential security vulnerabilities and apply updates or patches as necessary.
Deployment:

Deploy your API on a secure server with proper access controls and monitoring.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging to track user actions and system events. Monitor your API for performance and security using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or application-specific logging solutions.
Scale and Optimize:

As your application grows, consider optimizing and scaling your API to handle increased traffic and users. Load balancing and caching mechanisms can help improve performance.
Compliance:

Depending on your application's nature, ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and follow best practices for data security and privacy.
